#### Project description

Worked collaboratively in a team, to conduct user research
interviews. Designed and tested a prototype using Invision
for an interactive mobile system/application based around
the theme of healthy eating, we were given a real-life scenario project based around the topic of
health issues which are important to students. The eat in application is a for people who want to learn how to cook healthy meals and stay within their
budget it helps Provide students with a range of recipes and teaches them how to create the dish
by including cooking methods as well as a set cooking time. During the process of creating the eat in
application I contributed towards the tasks within the user research phase e.g. creating the design brief as
well as making the information sheet the interviewee’s read. I also helped create the visual icons and basic
wire frame for the final prototype and lastly I created the final presentation, displaying all our progress
throughout the project which was shown to the external client

#### Project outcome

Throughout the project we conducted user research in the form of semi structured interviews, designed
and tested a prototype for an interactive mobile system/application based around the theme of healthy
eating, During the process of creating the eat in application I contributed towards the tasks within the user
research phase e.g. creating the design brief as well as making the information sheet the interviewee’s
read. I also helped create the visual icons and basic wire frame for the final prototype lastly I created the
final presentation, showcasing all of our progress throughout the project which was shown to the external
client.From this project I have learnt that communication is vital when trying to create an
application within a group, it is important that each page is consistent with the content and the overall
layout of the elements on the page. The design and feel of the application will determine the users interests
with the content e.g. the choice of colours can affect how the app is perceived. 

Another part of creating an application which is crucial is the user research, by finding out the users
behaviour and needs you can create the interface based on that research and make the application more
personalised to the tailored audience needs e.g. students.
