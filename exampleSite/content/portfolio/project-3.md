Project Requirement

I will create a video infographic about the topic ‘What challenges Women in the UK digital media industry face each day’. My main audience of the project will be students studying for a media degree in addition to professional women in the industry. I will deliver a video infographic which will be fun and colourful yet still understandable and informative for students to watch. The use of animated/motion graphics will help grab the viewers’ attention therefore making it easier for information to be consumed in such a short amount of time. I will showcase my project at UWE in the digital media department, as well as at a conference based around digital media, and online via a blog based on women in technology. The importance of this project is crucial, the audience needs to learn about the importance of women in tech and the issue of the lack of gender diversity in digital media

Project Details

'Only one-in-six tech specialists in the UK are women, only one-in-ten are IT leaders and, worse still, despite significant growth in the number of women working in IT roles, female representation in the technology sector has stalled over the last ten years.' (The future of Women in IT - Women in Technology, 2020)

I have chosen to base my project on this topic, because there is an issue within the gender representation of the digital media industry, as a female digital media student I have learnt that my choice of work field is still a heavily male dominated area of work. I will present the output of my research in a visual form because design and creating visuals has always been a strength of mine. I have felt confident in the past working on animated/visual projects using Adobe After Effects and Illustrator.
