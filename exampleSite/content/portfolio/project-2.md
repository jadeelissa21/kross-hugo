#### Project Requirements

Whilst studying in my last year at UWE, i was asked to create and Design my own professional documents which can be used for employment after graduating. 
The required professional documents included (CV & Business card)


#### Project Details

I had a clear idea with how i wanted to create my professional documents, i wanted to expess my creative side and show my passion for designing and illustrating, the first document was the CV, whilst making my CV i wanted to it to be unique and interesting, using a template of Canva,The layout design was fit for the main purpose of the document, it was easy for employers to read and looked professionally organised. i enjoyed making this CV because i could add my own designs to the page without it seeming boring or filled with too much text, the images on the page were handmade using Adobe Illustrator, i chose a monochome detailing for the outlines of the drawings to create a minimalistic piece which is easy on the eyes contrasting to the bright background colours.

The second peice of work i made was the business card design, After looking online at many diffrent types of business card designs and inspirations i liked the idea of sticking with the outline peice i have made for the CV, after many trial and error vector images, i finally created the perfect design which i believe, displays my professional interest in the UX field of design and research. To add a little bit of pop to the card i then filled in parts of the design to create individual types of cards based off different colours this was a small tip i learnt from my tutors to personalise each card, make it something memorable.
